                    collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit.
                    The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color,
                    juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in

                    Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as
                    candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.

                    The cultivation of grapes began perhaps 8,000 years ago, and the fruit has been used as human food over history.

                    particularly for their role in winemaking. Other grape-derived products include various types of jam, juice, vinegar and oil.
